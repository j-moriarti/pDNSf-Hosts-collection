##### In this Repo, I've created a shell script to automate the process of collecting and compiling all the Hosts from various sources, then cleaning and optimizing it to be used in ["PersonalDNSfilter"](https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter/)
##### This collection is suitable for blocking the domains containing ads, tracking, malware, phishing, ransomware, spyware, trojans and virus (for PC and Smartphones).

  This hosts file is specially optimized for ["PersonalDNSfilter"](https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter/) app. This [Open-Source](https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter) app can handle Huge number of Domains without affecting on battery or ram usage! So there would be no problems adding these hosts to it!
  ###### !!! THIS HOSTS FILE IS EXTREMELY LARGE, and only pDNSf can easily handle it !!!
  ###### !!! Although applied whitelists to remove falsely blocked domains, but There may be a possibility of FALSE-POSITIVE or UNWANTED BLOCKING !!!
  ###### !!! Be prepared for manual whitelisting in pDNSf !!!
  ###### !!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED AGAIN!!!

    üìå Example of a LOCAL PATH format in pDNSf:
    PC version: file:///D:/Downloads folder/pDNSf-hosts.txt
    Mobile version: file:///sdcard/Downloads/pDNSf-hosts.txt
    
    üìå Use "pDNSf-hosts_no-whitelist.txt.gz" if you want to use the Hosts without applying "whitelists" or "redundant subdomains removing".
